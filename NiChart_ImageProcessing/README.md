## Definition:
Snakemake workflow definitions for NiChart image processing

## Contents:
* Eventually, this pipeline will include all NiChart processing steps (including fMRI and DTI)
* These steps will be run selectively and based on available data

## Notes:
* The "data" folder keeps all input and output data, with sym links to initial data in the "input" folder. Users can clear the contents of the data folder using the script misc/util_clear_data.sh (e.g. to check complete reproducibility)

## FIXME: Update this README as the workflow is updated
